# BEE2.4 Default Pack
 This pack for BEE2.4 contains the standard packages. Packages contain resources for BEE2.4 - items, styles, music, elevator videos, etc.

## Installation Instructions

### Release Version

* First, you should download the [standard BEE2.4 compiler from here](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4/releases)
* You will need to extract the zip file to anywhere on your computer. **You should not launch the program yet!**
* After that, you must go to the [releases page](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2-items/releases) to download the BEE2.4 Default Pack. **Make sure the releases match** - non-matching releases don't go well together.
* Next, you must extract the contents of the zip file to your **BEE2.4 compiler folder**.
* Finally, in order to launch BEE2.4, you must go to the `bin` folder and select `BEE2.exe` and open it. Once opened, you must select the game you want BEE2.4 to modify.

### Development Version

These are instructions to install the Development Version of the BEE2.4 Default Pack. This version will receive updates and bug-fixes to the selected branch in real time, but may be unstable. It is recommended that you use the Release Version instead.

* First, you need to install [GitHub Desktop from here](https://desktop.github.com/).
* After installation, you must clone this repository. **It must be done on [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)!**
* After cloning, you need to select a branch other than the `master` branch. Features which will be in the next release are on the `dev` branch
* Next, click the `Sync` button.
* Now you must go to the BEE2.4 config folder and open `config.cfg`. **Make sure you have the latest version.**
* You must set the package directory to your cloned repository folder. (e.g. `C:\Users\User\Documents\GitHub\BEE2-items`)
* Now open your BEE2.4 application. If it works, your files will be equal to the files of the `dev` branch.

Some items require a compiler change and will not work with the Release Version compiler. You will need the development version of the program for these items to work - see the [BEE2.4 readme](https://github.com/BEEmod/BEE2.4/blob/master/README.md) for instructions to install that.

## Additional Information

- **If you constantly recieve the message "Build Error: There was an error building the puzzle", even when there are no items in the map, make sure to post a console log to the issue you open.** To do this, enable the developer console (Settings>Controls>Allow Developer Console) and open it (\` by default). Copy the big block of red text.
- If you are editing on Hammer, anything that is placed in the folder `sdk_content\maps\instances\bee2` will be deleted if you export the BEE2.4 pallete without enabling the setting *Preserve Game Directories*. If you are editing any package, after you have finished, do not forget to save it inside the packages, by replacing the old files inside.
- BEE2.4 will crash if you are exporting while another folder or file is open that is important to the BEE2.4 compilation process.
- If you are having problems using BEE2.4, make sure to verify the game cache files of Portal 2 before using a new BEE2.4 Default Pack release. **The issue also could be from another BEE2.4 pack, not just the BEE2.4 Default Pack**
- It is recommended to have backups from the following Portal 2 folders: `sdk_content`, `portal2_dlc2`, and `bin`, just in case you need to restore your Portal 2 files.
